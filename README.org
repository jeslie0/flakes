#+title: Flakes
#+author: James Leslie
This flake contains all of my public github flakes as outputs. It means that I don't have to specify many inputs for my flakes, just this one! For my system flake, I have as an input:
#+begin_src nix
inputs.flakes.nix = github:jeslie0/flakes;
#+end_src
Then, if I want to use the swaybgchanger output for instance, I do something like this in my configuration.nix file:
#+begin_src nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs;
  [ ...
    self.inputs.flakes.swaybgchanger.defaultPackage.${system};
    ...
  ];

#+end_src
